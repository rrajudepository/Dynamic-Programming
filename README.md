<h1 align="center">📊 Dynamic Programming – Algorithms & Problem Solving Repository</h1>

<p align="center">
  A curated collection of **Dynamic Programming (DP)** problems, techniques, and implementations in C++.  
  This repo is aimed at learners who want to strengthen their DP understanding for contests, interviews, and algorithmic challenges.
</p>

## 📌 Overview

- Cover classical DP problems and patterns  
- Include multiple variants and optimizations (memoization, tabulation, space optimization)  
- Provide clear, well-commented C++ code  
- Use problem statements and test cases to practice  
- Structure content in a logical progression from simple → complex

---
## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Basic DP (Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs, etc.)
- 0/1 Knapsack and Unbounded Knapsack
- Sequence DP: LIS, LCS, Edit Distance, etc.
- Interval DP, Partition DP, Matrix Chain Multiplication
- DP with State Compression (Bitmask)
- Tree DP and Graph + DP Hybrid Techniques
- Optimization Techniques:
  - Space optimization
  - Rolling arrays
  - Transition improvements
